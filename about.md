I am an applied mathematician currently finishing a doctorate degree at University of Waterloo, Canada. My supervisor is <a href = "http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cbauch/"> Chris Bauch </a> and co-supervisor is <a href = "http://www.uoguelph.ca/~manand/Madhur_Anand/Welcome.html"> Madhur Anand </a>.


My research experience includes diseases modelling with vaccination dynamics, within-host disease modelling, and observing the interaction between human and ecosystem dynamics via mathematical modelling using socio-ecological models.


I am living with my wife in Waterloo.
